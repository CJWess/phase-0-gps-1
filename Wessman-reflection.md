Reflections
===========

1. I was definitely struggling with some of the git workflow before the GPS session.

2. The fetch and merge concepts were definitely clarified during the session, which was nice.

3. With my pair, it was mostly how to approach things or what our next steps should be. With the guide, we got stuck once or twice and simply asked for clarification.

4. Sometimes the branching seems a bit pointless for small things, though I understand the basic importance of incremental change.

5. The first experience was definitely not bad. It was more streamlined than I expected and I learned quite a bit in the process.
